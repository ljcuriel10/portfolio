        <h2>A little about me</h2>
         <img src="images/junelake.jpg" alt="June Lake, CA" width="500" height="500">
        <p>I'm from a very small town in the Eastern Sierra Mountains called June Lake, CA. If you like to ski or snowboard and are from the west coast you might of heard of Mammoth Mountain which is in my neighboring town. Growing up in the mountains I have come to love skiing, hiking, and overall just being outdoors. I'm also a very techy person so I've always dreamed of working in the tech industry. I am very excited about starting my career and finding jobs that I can be passionate about!</p>
        <p> If your looking for a hard working individual who is passionate about web design please contact me!</p>
